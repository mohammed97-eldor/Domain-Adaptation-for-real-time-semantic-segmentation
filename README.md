# Domain-Adaptation-for-real-time-semantic-segmentation

This Repository is a proposed solution for the domain adaptation of resl-time semantic segmentation from a synthetic dataset to a real world dataset.
It was a collaboration between me and my group mates in the university and supervised by Prof. Barbara Caputo.

The project reruns some tests of the BiSeNet that is a network well famous for semantic segmentation, then adds an adversarial learning approach to it, and finally We used the Fourier Domain adaptation to improve the results.

Please for running the code download the datasets from here:
CamVid: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CKtkLRVU4tGbqLSyFEtJMoZV2ZZ2KDeA/view
IDDA: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GiUjXp1YBvnJjAf1un07hdHFUrchARa0/view
Place the datasets in the dataset files and make sure that the specified directory of the datasets matches the ones in the train file.
